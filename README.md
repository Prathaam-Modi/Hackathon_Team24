Team Number 24 - Student Council Voting System

Project Overview
This project has been purely built on Android Studio platform meant to run on all Android OS comaptible devices. Its a realtime database implied project making the data manipulation way more efficient and accessible by the admin and interactable by the students. It also implies Email/User authentication as per the question required.

What problem did the team try to solve?
Amidst this pandemic situation and the heat of elections, polling around the world was done in different ways. Some resorted to postal ballots while some ensured that Covid
safeguards are heightened at the ballot houses.

What is the proposed solution?
We need to have all the physical activities done over a virtual online platform which could make things easier with the help of a dynamic system.

Solution Description:
An android apk build with a complete dynamic datachain implementation system, this application makes it very easy for the administrator to manipulate the candidates in the database and also easy for the students to Vote their trustworthy candidates with the help of a very minimalistic UI design. It is supported by a RealTime Database which helps the administrator add/delete certain data values from the database which immediately reflects to the student side. Also we have implemented the Transaction system to avoid the Updation of multiple votes at the same time. Also the admin will get the analytics in the form of live poll.
